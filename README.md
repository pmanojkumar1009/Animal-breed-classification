# Animal-breed-classification


In animal care, veterinary services, and animal management, accurately identifying animal breeds is critical for providing the best care and managing breed-specific needs. However, manually classifying animal breeds is challenging due to the subtle differences among certain breeds, especially for images of similar-looking cats and dogs. The objective of this project is to automate animal breed classification using advanced deep learning techniques, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in breed identification.
